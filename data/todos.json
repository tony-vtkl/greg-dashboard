APPROACH: Move forward faster by leveraging each other's progress. Goal: capture market share and solidify first mover advantage as a brand.\n\n3. BRAND VISION: A brand that quickly produces working software from obscure requirements. Also product verticals for executive coaching, biohacking, fitness, dating, etc.\n\n4. KENDO STRATEGY: They have delivery problems — we become their outsource solution for delivery. Don't introduce new workflow (causes resistance). Just deliver results.\n\nKEY INSIGHT: AI sells fastest when it doesn't require humans to change. Ron and Kendo will not change.",
